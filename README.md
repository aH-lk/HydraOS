# Basic Operating System in C, C++, Assembly, and Make

## Introduction

In this project, we will develop a basic operating system using a combination of programming languages, including C, C++, Assembly, and build automation with Make. This project aims to provide a fundamental understanding of operating system development and the integration of various languages and tools.

## Technologies Used

- **C**: Used for low-level system programming and core functionality implementation.
- **C++**: Employed for object-oriented programming and higher-level system components.
- **Assembly**: Utilized for low-level hardware interactions and optimizing critical sections of the code.
- **Make**: A  build automation tool, simplifying the build process and managing dependencies.

## Implementation Details

### Bootloader (Assembly)

The bootloader, written in Assembly, is responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory and transferring control to the kernel code.

### Kernel (C and C++)

- **kernel.c**: Contains low-level functionality such as memory management, hardware interactions, and system calls.
- **kernel.hpp**: Includes class definitions and higher-level system components like process management, file system, and device drivers.

## Build Process with Make

The build process is managed by Make, ensuring efficient compilation and linking of source files. The `Makefilet` file in the `src` directory contains build configurations and dependencies.

### Building the Project

To build the project, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make
```

This command will compile the bootloader, kernel, and other necessary components, generating binary files in the `build` directory.

## Running the Operating System

To run the operating system in an emulator, follow the instructions provided in the `docs/usage.md` file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the development of a basic operating system using a combination of C, C++, Assembly, and Make. By exploring this project, developers can gain insights into low-level system programming, language integration, and build automation, paving the way for more complex operating system projects and system-level optimizations.
